## Rule 1
> Worst case is the only thing we consider (Big O is exact or upper bound)

## Rule 2
> Ignore constants - constants are constant and do not grow in proportion to input size, so we ignore them

## Rule 3
> We use different terms for inputs coming in. n relates to input size, but we could have k, n, and p. Each of these will be considered separately when calcing big O

## Rule 4
> Drop the terms that are not the biggest term in the notation. Order is in [[Order of growth]]

C < log(log(n)) < log(n) < n^1/3 < n^1/2 < n < n^2 < n^3 < n^4 < 2^n < n^n
