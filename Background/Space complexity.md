Space complexity is how memory is affected by input size. We use the same [[asymptotic notations]] when expressing this.

Variables represent a constant space.

Arrays are linear generally as they will always take up the number of items in space.

Auxilary space is temporary space in terms of input size (basically anything that is not output based).

Key signal for aux space is temp vars as pointers or running totals. Same rules apply as above

Heap and stack. Heap is RAM, stack is CPU register (generally, could be CPU cache too)
